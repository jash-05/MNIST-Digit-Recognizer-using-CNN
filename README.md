# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer-using-CNN

This repository contains my Jupyter notebook code for the 'Digit Recognizer' competition on Kaggle. 
I've used Keras with Tensorflow on the backend, to train a Convolutional Neural Network on the 'train.csv' data. 


Running for 1 epoch, gives an accuracy of around 97%.

Running for 30 epochs, gives an accuracy of 99.585%


The first few cells of the notebook also contain code for uploading and importing csv files to Google Colab, which is the cloud based GPU environment I have used for faster computation.
